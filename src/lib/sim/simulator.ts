/**
 * Produces realistic venue snapshots for a scenario and tick.
 *
 * Two decisions shape this module:
 *
 *  1. **It is a pure function of (scenario, tick), not a stateful loop.** Cloud
 *     Run may serve consecutive polls from different instances; anything held in
 *     process memory would make the feed jump between them. Deriving each
 *     snapshot from the tick index means every instance agrees, and a test can
 *     ask for tick 47 directly instead of stepping there.
 *
 *  2. **Randomness is seeded, never `Math.random()`.** The jitter that makes the
 *     feed feel alive is derived from (seed, tick, subject), so the same tick
 *     always yields the same numbers. A demo is reproducible and a failing test
 *     is debuggable.
 *
 * The arrival model is a first-order integration of a fill curve: arrivals per
 * minute peak shortly before kickoff, gates process what they can, and the
 * remainder queues. Occupancy is the integral of what actually got through.
