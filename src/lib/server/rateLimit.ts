// A fixed-window counter held in process memory. Two deliberate limitations:
//  - Per-instance, not global: with N serverless instances a user gets N windows.
//    Fine for protecting a demo's Gemini quota; a real multi-instance deployment
//    would move this behind the interface below to Redis or Firestore.
//  - Fixed window, not sliding: a user can burst across a window boundary.
//    Acceptable at these limits; a token bucket would be the upgrade.
